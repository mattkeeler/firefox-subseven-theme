![Screenshot of SubSeven Theme](img/subseven-theme.png)

## Description

A Firefox theme with the SubSeven color palette. Currently this is just a `src/manifest.json` file, but future iterations may include CSS-enhanced alternatives to choose from.

## Installation

This theme is pending review on the Mozilla add-ons hub.

In the meantime, you can install the unsigned theme using the `.xpi` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/mattkeeler/firefox-subseven-theme/releases/latest). Unsigned themes can be installed in two ways:

- temporarily via `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
- permanently by using a build like [developer edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) or [nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/112.0a1/releasenotes/), and setting `xpinstall.signatures.required = false` in `about:config`
